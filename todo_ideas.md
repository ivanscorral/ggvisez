Note: *This document was generated by Claude-2, and has not been totally reviewed or validated*

## General Refactoring

- Split code into modules/domains
  - E.g. encoding, visualization, compression etc
- Standardize error handling
  - Custom error types vs panics
- Improve test coverage
  - Focus on core algorithms and complex areas

## Encoding

- Add codec versioning
  - Handle backwards compatibility
- Make encoding configurable
  - Toggle compression, checksums etc
- Benchmark different encoding approaches
  - Tradeoff compression ratio vs speed

## Decoding

- Streaming/progressive decoding
  - Avoid decoding everything upfront
- Concurrent decoding
  - Leverage multi-core CPUs
- Custom memory allocators
  - Efficient buffer reuse

## Quadtree

- Generic algorithms
  - Make quadtree structure/algorithms reusable
- Space partitioning optimizations
  - Other data structures like KD trees
- Parallel queries
  - Spread work across threads
- Secondary indexing
  - Accelerate common access patterns

## Visualization

- Optimize rendering
  - Batch draw calls, use GPU, cull invisible
- Level of detail
  - Adaptively reduce detail for far away
- Asynchronous loading
  - Background loading and streaming

## Compression

- Experiment with different algorithms
  - LZ4, Zstd, Brotli, etc.
- Optimize for quadtrees
  - Leverage spatial coherence
- Parallel compression

## Overall

- Profile guided optimization
  - Measure before optimizing
- Benchmark end-to-end pipeline
  - Encode -> compress -> decode -> render
- Custom memory allocators
  - Reuse buffers, reduce fragmentation
